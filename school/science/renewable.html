            <td class="energy"><h3><strong>Renewables In Norway</strong></h3>
            In Norway 98% of all energy comes from renewable energy sources, 
            hydropower is by far the most predominant energy source
            <a class="source" href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/energy/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-production-in-norway/id2343462/#:~:text=In%20Norway%2C%2098%20percent%20of,of%20most%20of%20the%20production.&text=Electricity%20production%20in%20Norway%20is,to%20the%20Norwegian%20electricity%20production.">[source]</a>
            <a class="source" href="https://energiogklima.no/nyhet/datakilder/status-for-vindkraft-i-norge/#:~:text=Vindkraft%20sto%20for%206%2C4,15%20nye%20vindkraftverk%2C%20if%C3%B8lge%20NVE.">[source]</a>.
            As well as hydro windpower is about 6.6% of total energy production. 
            Other possible energy sources include solar, biofuels and wavepower. 
            While solar energy is in use in Norway its no where near other energy sources prodominenly being used in the private homes, shops and factories.
            The envirmental impacts of renewable energy sources is mostly local with dams covering entire vallyes with water, 
            and windmills beeing quite ugly, loud and killing some unintelegent birds that don't understand the concept of <i>rotation</i>.

            Tonnstad Kraftverk is owned and operated by <a class="blank_link" href="https://www.sirakvina.no/">Sira Kvine Kraftselskap</a>
            which accounts for 5% of norways energy production, 
            with this one powerstation accountig for 3.4% of the entire energy production of norway. 
            This is also the biggest hydrostation in norway with 1.4 GW of yearly energy production
            <a class="source" href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_over_vannkraftverk_i_Norge">[source]</a><a class="source" href="https://www.sirakvina.no/">[source]</a>.
            <h3>Construction and expantion</h3>
            The dam complex was started in 1963 and finished in 1968, and has since then been expanded several times: 1968-71, 1971-74, 1974-79, 1985-92 and in 2010
            <a class="source" href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sira-Kvina_Kraftselskap#Utbyggingsfasen">[source]</a>.
            Most of the expantions were building multiple new dams around the valley,
            including the dam shown in the picture above.
            The construction resulted in large areas beeing flooded with water, flooding nature, paths and husts.
